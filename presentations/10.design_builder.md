### >>> Design Builder
- a Nautobot App for creating objects based on designs
- basically a YAML to Nautobot object converter
- ...but with Jinja2 templating
- ...and with extra superpowers!

---
<!-- _header: Design Builder YAML structure -->

```yaml
---
# Simple statement
tenants:
  - name: "Autocon3"

# Nested statement (child inherits parent)
providers:
  - name: "NTC"
    provider_networks:

# Deep attributes with dunder
locations:
  - name: "Prague"
    location_type__name: "Region"
    status__name: "Active"
```
